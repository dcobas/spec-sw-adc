The headers have been derived from what is in svn:
documentation/specifications/hdlspec/memory_map/

In that directory you find the html generated from the wb files.
Here I import the relevant headers.  The overall register
map is in ../nic/nic-hardware.h .

The .wb files whence the headers are generated come from different
plases in the white rabbit svn. To ease myself I wrote this in
the Makefile. You can "make wbinput" to get a fresh copy of them,
provided you have SVN set in your environment (point to the root
checkout, before "trunk" subdirectory). If unset or wrong, cp fails.

With "make headers" you can regenerate the headers from the wb input
files. Each generated file is postprocesses with sed to fix these
issues:

* generated files include <inttypes.h> as they use uint32_t.  We want
<linux/types.h> instead, as no <inttypes.h> nor <stdint.h> is there

* generated files include the date of creation. This brings to noise
in the "git diff" or plain "diff", so I'd better have no date.

* creation of "#ifdef __THIS_HEADER__" fails on the dash, so I remove
the dash and trailing part with sed (as of writing, it has issues with
pathnames too, this is one the reasons why I copy the wb here first).
